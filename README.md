## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Full-Stack Developer in Mexico🏜️💻,
My skills were acquired during over 18 months of development as a programmer. I started from scratch, and it's something that I have been passionate about doing. 

I have proven to myself that I can continue doing it without stopping to learn. I enjoy challenges, and I always strive to be my best version in order to finish projects on time and in the right way. 

I always seek to improve my personal skills🙋‍♂️, and I consider myself someone who is consistent, proactive, communicative, accurate, and patient in resolving code conflicts.
